# rocq-lsp-client

An OCaml library for programmatic communication with the [rocq-lsp](https://github.com/ejgallego/rocq-lsp) language server.

`rocq-lsp-client` lets you start a `coq-lsp` process from OCaml code, send LSP commands (e.g. `textDocument/hover`, `textDocument/didOpen`), and receive structured responses.

## üöÄ Overview

This library provides a lightweight **LSP client** implementation specialized for **rocq-lsp** (the Coq language server).
It is intended for tools or research projects that need to interact with Coq via LSP without relying on an editor.

Internally, it:
- spawns a `rocq-lsp` process,
- communicates using JSON-RPC 2.0 via stdin/stdout,
- and provides OCaml functions for sending requests and parsing responses.
